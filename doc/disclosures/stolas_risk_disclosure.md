## 1. Purpose of This Document
This Risk Disclosure Statement outlines certain material risks associated with interacting with the **stOLAS protocol** and its related smart contracts.  

Participation in the protocol is entirely voluntary and at the user’s own discretion.  
This document does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice.

---

## 2. User Classification
Participants in the protocol are referred to as **users**.  
By interacting with the protocol, users acknowledge that they do so **on their own behalf**, assuming all associated risks and responsibilities.  
No part of the stOLAS protocol should be interpreted as an investment solicitation or guarantee of profit.

---

## 3. Nature of Rewards
The stOLAS protocol enables users to receive **staking-related rewards** that reflect their proportional share of the total staked OLAS tokens.  

These rewards are:  
- **Determined by the OLAS protocol**, in accordance with its native staking mechanisms and reward distribution rules ([olas.network/staking](https://olas.network/staking));  
- **Variable** and subject to change based on network activity, services performance, and overall protocol parameters;  
- **Not guaranteed**, and may increase or decrease over time depending on market and governance factors within the OLAS ecosystem.

Users should understand that any staking rewards accrue from the OLAS protocol itself, not from Lemon Tree Technologies LTD or the stOLAS platform, and that there is no assurance of fixed or risk-free returns.

---

## 4. Smart Contract and Technical Risks
The protocol operates entirely through autonomous smart contracts.  
Such systems may contain vulnerabilities, bugs, or unintentional behavior that could lead to partial or total loss of digital assets.  
Despite audits and testing, there is no guarantee of absolute security or uninterrupted operation.

---

## 5. Market and Economic Risks
The value of stOLAS tokens and underlying OLAS tokens may fluctuate due to market dynamics, liquidity conditions, and other factors beyond our control.  
Users may experience loss in token value or reduced liquidity at any time.

---

## 6. Regulatory and Legal Risks
Digital assets and staking activities may be subject to changing regulations in different jurisdictions.  
Users are responsible for understanding and complying with local laws that may apply to their participation.

---

## 7. No Custody or Guarantee
The stOLAS protocol is **non-custodial** — users maintain control over their assets at all times.  
Lemon Tree Technologies LTD does not have access to user funds and does not offer insurance, guarantees, or recourse in case of loss or malfunction.

---

## 8. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, **Lemon Tree Technologies LTD**, its contributors, and affiliates shall not be liable for any damages or losses arising from use of the stOLAS protocol, including but not limited to:
- Smart contract vulnerabilities or exploits;  
- Validator performance or network instability;  
- Market price fluctuations;  
- Regulatory changes or enforcement actions.
