Executive Summary
stOLAS is a revolutionary liquid staking solution for the OLAS token in the Autonolas ecosystem, designed to democratize access to staking rewards while maintaining full DeFi liquidity. Unlike traditional staking that requires technical expertise and infrastructure management, stOLAS provides a seamless, cross-chain staking experience that automatically deploys and manages services on behalf of users.

Built on the ERC4626 vault standard with a sophisticated cross-chain architecture, stOLAS bridges the gap between L1 (Ethereum) for user interactions and L2 (Gnosis Chain) for active staking operations. This design ensures maximum security for user deposits while enabling efficient, automated service deployment and reward collection.

The system's core innovation lies in its intelligent staking management: users simply deposit OLAS and receive stOLAS tokens, while the protocol automatically handles service deployment, monitoring, and reward distribution across multiple chains. This creates a truly liquid staking experience where users maintain full DeFi composability while earning passive staking yields.

Introduction to stOLAS
The Autonolas ecosystem represents a paradigm shift in autonomous service coordination, where OLAS tokens power a decentralized network of intelligent agents and services. Traditional participation in this ecosystem requires users to deploy, manage, and maintain complex infrastructure - a barrier that has limited widespread adoption despite the ecosystem's potential.

stOLAS eliminates these barriers by abstracting away the technical complexity of service deployment and staking management. Users gain exposure to OLAS staking rewards through a simple deposit mechanism, while the protocol handles all operational aspects automatically.

The system operates on a dual-layer architecture:
- L1 (Ethereum): User deposits, withdrawals, and vault management
- L2 (Gnosis Chain): Active staking, service deployment, and reward collection

This architecture ensures that users can interact with the system on the most secure and liquid chain (Ethereum) while benefiting from the cost-effective and efficient staking operations on Gnosis Chain.

Token Utility and Value Proposition
stOLAS serves as a pure utility token representing ownership of staked OLAS assets. Each stOLAS token is backed 1:1 by OLAS deposits, with the backing ratio potentially increasing over time as staking rewards accumulate.

Key utility aspects:

1. **Liquidity Preservation**: stOLAS tokens can be freely traded, transferred, and used across the entire DeFi ecosystem without losing staking exposure.

2. **Automated Yield Generation**: Users earn staking rewards automatically without managing services, monitoring performance, or handling technical operations.

3. **Cross-Chain Efficiency**: The system automatically bridges assets between chains to optimize for both security (L1) and efficiency (L2).

4. **DeFi Composability**: stOLAS integrates seamlessly with existing DeFi protocols, enabling users to leverage their staked assets for additional yield opportunities.

5. **Governance Separation**: stOLAS focuses purely on utility, while governance rights are handled through a future vstOLAS token, ensuring optimal token design for each use case.

- TokenRelayers: Handle token transfers between chains
- MessageRelayers: Synchronize data and state across chains

Operational Workflow

1. **Deposit Process**
   - User deposits OLAS into stOLAS vault on L1
   - stOLAS tokens are minted 1:1 (initially)
   - OLAS is bridged to L2 via LayerZero
   - StakingManager deploys services with OLAS backing
   - User receives stOLAS representing their staking position

2. **Staking Operations**
   - Services operate on L2 with OLAS backing
   - Rewards accumulate based on service performance
   - ActivityModule verifies service liveness
   - Collector gathers rewards and prepares bridging

3. **Reward Distribution**
   - Rewards are bridged from L2 to L1
   - Distributor splits rewards between veOLAS and stOLAS
   - stOLAS total assets are updated
   - Users can claim rewards or let them compound

4. **Withdrawal Process**
   - User requests withdrawal through Treasury
   - ERC6909 tokens are minted for withdrawal tracking
   - If L1 has sufficient OLAS: immediate withdrawal
   - If not: L2 unstaking is triggered and bridged back
   - User finalizes withdrawal after cool-down period

5. **Model Management**
   - Staking models can be retired when services are deprecated
   - Retired models allow gradual unstaking
   - System maintains full backing during retirement process
   - Closed models release all remaining OLAS to users
